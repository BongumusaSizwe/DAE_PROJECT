    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to present a study that will investigate factors that influence the evaluation of the property value of the properties of the Mbombela Municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study will model the relationship between each of these different factors and the property value using the dataset from the property evaluation roll which was conducted in 2010 within the area of Mbombela by the Mbombela Municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main result of this study will be a linear model in this form - $y = \\beta_o + \\beta_1 * x_1 + \\beta_2* x_2 + ...$ $ where, \\ \\   x_i  \\ \\ where \\ i\\ = \\ {{0, 1, ... , n}} \\ $  represents the $ x^{ith}$ feature which influence the market value (y) of the property and $ \\ \\beta_i \\ \\ where \\ i \\ =  \\ {0, 1, 2, .., n } \\ $ is the weight of the $\\ x^{ith} \\$ feature.In addition we will also make use graphical representation that will show the relationships between the distinct features which have a direct causal influence in determining the market value of the properties,  and the market value of the properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "We did not get a similar dataset to this one, which was collected prior 2010 or after 2010, which we can use to compare this dataset to or use it to test our model (test our model on a dataset from a different time period). The dataset was not accompanied by a data description hence we have no rich knowledge about the true meaning of some of the features , how the dataset was collected and how the properties used on the dataset were selected. Furthermore, the dataset is incomplete, since some of the features contained null values for the majority of their values. The data was only collected from Mbombela Mpumalanga, making it difficult for our dataset to represent the entire population of South Africa."

    "# <b>Introduction:</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every four years, the local municipalities in South Africa conduct a general evaluation roll that determines the municipal values of homes and the property rates that should be paid based on these values and ultimately, the price of the property. The property owners usually have objections to the property values determined by the municipality as these values are usually too low for a property value or too high for the prices that the owners must pay for using the municipality services. The property owners usually do not know how the municipality got to the property prices that come after the evaluation, as with the recent evaluation in where property owners experienced a hike in municipality bills. \\[ [Private Property](https://www.privateproperty.co.za/advice/news/articles/property-valuations-shock-what-homeowners-can-do/6230)\\]\n",

The dataset contains over 57000 data points which have 49 features that describe some of the properties in Mbombela Municipality. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Date collected:\n",
    "The data was collected in Mbombela Municipal Council, in Mpumalanga, South Africa, in 2010. The last time the data modified was on December 21, 2017, 1:09 PM (UTC+02:00)\n",

Sectional Title, as a form of ownership (as per the Sectional Titles Act No.95 of 1986), emerged originally to permit parties to buy a piece or section of a larger property / building / development in a fashion where there ownership (or title) is protected (under Sectional Title law) and where there are clear rules and guidelines on how the overall property is managed, maintained and run. \n",

    "#### Aspects of Data Quality:\n",
    "- The data was retrieved from openAFRICA , openAFRICA is not a government portal. Instead, it’s a grassroots initiative, maintained by Code for Africa, as a public service.OpenAFRICA has additional support from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the World Bank, both well known and accredited organisation thus making our source openAFRICA an accredible source.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data collection was done in 2010 and the evaluations of Market Value where done around the same time interval 2008 to 2010 making our Market values comparison fair because the amounts where not effected by other time factors like inflation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The data was collected from the same region(Mbombeni)\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of completness of data, we have some missing values from some cloumns, most notably columns BC Tariff, BC Value and SGNumber having no values at all. Columns Sect Title No, Empty Stand Ind, Postal Addr3, Postal Addr4, Postal Addr5, Deed No and StandDescrip have alot of missing values as well. The rest of the columns are mostly filled with a minimal of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The columns are consistent in terms of the data type of each column.\n",
    "- In terms of Unifromaty most of the columns have a consistent use of units and scales except for the column'Owner Type' as this has some numeric values which are unexplained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ability to answer question:\n",
    "Considering our Question 'What factors dertermine the property value and to what extent do these factors contribute to the value of the property?' our dataset has adequate variables like size of property, owners of property etc, to tackle this question. At high sight after close data analyse, it is clear to see that our varibles might not be the best individually to tackle our question as no varible individually has a strong relationship with our predictive variable (Market value)."
