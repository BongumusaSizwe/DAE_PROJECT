The dataset was not accompanied by a data description hence we have no rich knowledge about the true meaning of some of the features , how the dataset was collected and how the properties used on the dataset were selected. Furthermore, the dataset is incomplete, since some of the features contained null values for the majority of their values. The data was only collected from Mbombela Mpumalanga, making it difficult for our dataset to represent the entire population of South Africa."

        "Every four years, the local municipalities in South Africa conduct a general evaluation roll that determines the municipal values of homes and the property rates that should be paid based on these values and ultimately, the price of the property. The property owners usually have objections to the property values determined by the municipality as these values are usually too low for a property value or too high for the prices that the owners must pay for using the municipality services. The property owners usually do not know how the municipality got to the property prices that come after the evaluation, as with the recent evaluation in where property owners experienced a hike in municipality bills. \\[ [Private Property](https://www.privateproperty.co.za/advice/news/articles/property-valuations-shock-what-homeowners-can-do/6230)\\]\n",

Columns Sect Title No, Empty Stand Ind, Postal Addr3, Postal Addr4, Postal Addr5, Deed No and StandDescrip have alot of missing values as well. The rest of the columns are mostly filled with a minimal of missing values.\n",

        "#### Ability to answer question:\n",
        "Considering our Question 'What factors dertermine the property value and to what extent do these factors contribute to the value of the property?' our dataset has adequate variables like size of property, owners of property etc, to tackle this question. At high sight after close data analyse, it is clear to see that our varibles might not be the best individually to tackle our question as no varible individually has a strong relationship with our predictive variable (Market value)."
