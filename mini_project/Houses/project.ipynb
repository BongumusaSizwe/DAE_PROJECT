    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to present a study that will investigate factors that influence the evaluation of the property value of the properties of the Mbombela Municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study will model the relationship between each of these different factors and the property value using the dataset from the property evaluation roll which was conducted in 2010 within the area of Mbombela by the Mbombela Municipality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main result of this study will be a linear model in this form -  $y = \\beta_o + \\beta_1 * x_1 + \\beta_2* x_2 + ...$ $ where, \\ \\   x_i  \\ \\ where \\ i\\ = \\ {{0, 1, ... , n}} \\ $  represents the $ x^{ith}$ feature which influence the market value (y) of the property and $ \\ \\beta_i \\ \\ where \\ i \\ =  \\ {0, 1, 2, .., n } \\ $ is the weight of the $\\ x^{ith} \\$ feature.In addition we will also make use graphical representation that will show the relationships between the distinct features which have a direct causal influence in determining the market value of the properties,  and the market value of the properties.\n",

    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "We did not get a similar dataset to this one, which was collected prior 2010 or after 2010, which we can use to compare this dataset to or use it to test our model (test our model on a dataset from a different time period). The dataset was not accompanied by a data description hence we have no rich knowledge about the true meaning of some of the features , how the dataset was collected and how the properties used on the dataset were selected. Furthermore, the dataset is incomplete, since some of the features contained null values for the majority of their values. The data was only collected from Mbombela Mpumalanga, making it difficult for our dataset to represent the entire population of South Africa."

    "\n",
    "Every four years, the local municipalities in South Africa conduct a general evaluation roll that determines the municipal values of homes and the property rates that should be paid based on these values and ultimately, the price of the property. The property owners usually have objections to the property values determined by the municipality as these values are usually too low for a property value or too high for the prices that the owners must pay for using the municipality services. The property owners usually do not know how the municipality got to the property prices that come after the evaluation, as with the recent evaluation in where property owners experienced a hike in municipality bills. \\[ [Private Property](https://www.privateproperty.co.za/advice/news/articles/property-valuations-shock-what-homeowners-can-do/6230)\\]\n",
